### Overview
Our application will essentially be an e-commerce website that will allow users to search for and purchase digital copies of movies.
This application  will be useful to use by users due to the simplicity and the search and filter by genre functions.
The idea was a combination of two of my group members ideas, in which one wanted to make an e-commerce website and the other wanted to have a movie database of some kind.
